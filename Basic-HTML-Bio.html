  Currently, I am a social worker at Chicago Methodist Senior Services looking for a new challenge in my career. In May 2014 I graduated from Carthage College in Kenosha, WI with a bachelorâ€™s degree in International Political Economy and a minor in Sociology. My academic career as well as relevant work experience at Knowledge Oncology, LLC have prepared me for the position in data science.
